# Mirror
Welcome to the mirror app for android. A simple mirror using your front camera.
Currently This is a pre-release application, so it means it will have some rough edges and feature missing, but you are still welcomed to fix bugs, translate this app by sending a Pull Request or opening an Issue.
## Features
 * Just a mirrror, no ads, no background tracking (just see the source code if you don't trust me);
 * a minimal app, no neccesary effect or information, or settings, since CameraX will choose the correct resolution for you.
 * free to use/modify, with GNU GPL covered.
## System requirements
 * Needs Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or later to work;
 * currently have not supported for the Android 13 (Tiramisu).
## Current Bugs
These are the bugs we need you (developers) to fix:
 * The Full-Screen feature is deprecated in Java (MainActivity.kt)
 * This is locked to landscape orientation due to it will crashes when you rotate in the 1.0.1-alpha release of Mirror, so it will affect some of chromebook users with multi-window mode using this application.
